For this I hope you have basic knowledge of Class loader in java.
How the class loader will load the .class file? In which order?

	class loader-->
		Bootstrap class loader(rt.jar)-->
			Extension class loader(ext folder)-->
				Application class loader
					(classpath)

when class loader given a call to search .class file,it first searches in bootstrap class loader rt.jar,
And if it is not there then ext folder i.e  extension class loader.And again if it is not there then Application
class loader i.e. our classPath
